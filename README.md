# Dust

A modern theme for Obsidian.

This is a fork of [obsidian-atom](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom) with some changes based on my opinion.

---

- The codeblock theme is based on [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme).
- New default accent color.
- Accent color can be changed.
- New folder icon
- Google Material Icon for files
- Graph View lines match the accent color but they're slightly brighter.
- More discrete status bar.
- [Full Calendar Plugin](https://github.com/davish/obsidian-full-calendar) support (the events **will** match your accent color).
- And some other minor changes...
